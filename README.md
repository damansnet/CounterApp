CounterApp

This is a console application to demonstrate the string search rules.

Step 1 : You have to enter any string.

After this program will iterate through to the four rules. 
You can skip any rule by entering -1
For example:
Find Average length of word starting with {0}
you can enter a|A which means will look for word starting with a or A

Count the sequence of words starting with {0} and {1}
b|B - means word starts with b or B
e|E - means next word starts with e or E

Like wise you can use other rules too.

All the output of the rules are written to the output files in the CounterRules\bin\Debug folder.

PS: Please do share your thoughts about this with me.

There is always room for improvments!!
Happy Coding...
