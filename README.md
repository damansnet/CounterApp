# CounterApp
CounterApp

This is a console application to demonstrate the string search rules.

Step 1 : You have to enter any string.

After this program will iterate through to the four rules. 
You can skip any rule by entering -1
All the output of the rules are written to the output files in the CounterRules\bin\Debug folder.

PS: Please do share your thoughts about this with me.

There is always room for improvments!!
Happy Coding...
